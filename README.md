## [Don't ask to ask, just ask!](https://dontasktoask.com/)

An informational website about why you should ask questions directly instead of asking to ask!

Every now and then, in online chat rooms I hang around in, someone pops in and says something in the lines of,

> Foobar123: Any Java experts around?
This is bad form, for several reasons. What the person is actually asking here is,

> Foobar123: Any Java experts around who are willing to commit into looking into my problem, whatever that may turn out to be, even if it's not actually related to Java or if someone who doesn't know anything about Java could actually answer my question?
There are plenty of reasons why people who DO have the knowledge would not admit to it. By asking, you're asking for more than what you think you're asking.

You're asking people to take responsibility. You're questioning people's confidence in their abilities. You're also unnecessarily walling other people out. I often answer questions related to languages or libraries I have never used, because the answers are (in a programmer kind of way) common sense.

Alternatively, it can be seen as,

> Foobar123: I have a question about Java but I'm too lazy to actually formalize it in words unless there's someone on the channel who might be able to answer it which is just lazy. If you're not willing to do the work to solve your problem, why should we?

The solution is not to ask to ask, but just to ask. Someone who is idling on the channel and only every now and then glances what's going on is unlikely to answer to your "asking to ask" question, but your actual problem description may pique their interest and get them to answer.

### So, to summarize, don't ask
> "Any Java experts around?",

### But rather ask 
> "How do I do [problem] with Java and [other relevant info]?"

## [No Hello](https://www.nohello.com/)

Please Don't Say Just Hello In Chat

> 2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hi

> 2010-07-19 12:32:15 co-worker: Hello.

CO-WORKER WAITS WHILE YOU PHRASE YOUR QUESTION

> 2010-07-19 12:34:01 you: I'm working on [something] and I'm trying to do [etc...]

> 2010-07-19 12:35:21 co-worker: Oh, that's [answer...]
 

It's as if you called someone on the phone and said "Hi!" and then put them on hold!

Please do this instead:

> 2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hi -- I'm working on [something] and I'm trying to do [etc...]

> 2010-07-19 12:33:32 co-worker: [answers question]  

**Note** that you get help minutes sooner, and you don't make them wait. Instead, the co-worker can start thinking about your question right away!

You're trying to be polite by not jumping right into the request, like you would do in person or on the phone. But Chat is neither of those things. Typing is much slower than talking. Instead of being polite, you are just making the other person wait for you to phrase your question, which is lost productivity.

The same goes for 
> "Hello -- Are you there?", "Hi Bob -- quick question.", "Do you have a sec ?", "yt?" and "ping".

### Just ask the question

If you feel it's brusque to simply say "Hi" and ask the question, you can do something like this:

> 2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hi -- if you're not busy I was wondering if I could ask a question.  I'm working on [something] and I'm trying to do [etc...]

Additionally, asking your question before getting a reply allows asynchronous communication. If the other party is away, and you leave before they come back, they can still answer your question, instead of just staring at a "Hello" and wondering what they missed.


## [How do I ask a good question](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)

To improve your chances of getting an answer, here are some tips:

### Search, and research
...and keep track of what you find. Even if you don't find a useful answer elsewhere on the site, including links to related questions that haven't helped can help others in understanding how your question is different from the rest.

### Write a title that summarizes the specific problem
The title is the first thing potential answerers will see, and if your title isn't interesting, they won't read the rest. So make it count:

Pretend you're talking to a busy colleague and have to sum up your entire question in one sentence: what details can you include that will help someone identify and solve your problem? Include any error messages, key APIs, or unusual circumstances that make your question different from similar questions already on the site.

### Spelling, grammar and punctuation are important
 Remember, this is the first part of your question others will see - you want to make a good impression. If you're not comfortable writing in English, ask a friend to proof-read it for you.

If you're having trouble summarizing the problem, write the title last - sometimes writing the rest of the question first can make it easier to describe the problem.

**Examples:**

- **Bad:** C# Math Confusion
- **Good:** Why does using float instead of int give me different results when all of my inputs are integers?
- **Bad:** [php] session doubt
- **Good:** How can I redirect users to different pages based on session data in PHP?
- **Bad:** android if else problems
- **Good:** Why does str == "value" evaluate to false when str is set to "value"?

Introduce the problem before you post any code
In the body of your question, start by expanding on the summary you put in the title. 

Explain how you encountered the problem you're trying to solve, and any difficulties that have prevented you from solving it yourself. 

The first paragraph in your question is the second thing most readers will see, so make it as engaging and informative as possible.

### Help others reproduce the problem
Not all questions benefit from including code, but if your problem is with code you've written, you should include some. But don't just copy in your entire program! Not only is this likely to get you in trouble if you're posting your employer's code, it likely includes a lot of irrelevant details that readers will need to ignore when trying to reproduce the problem. Here are some guidelines:

Include just enough code to allow others to reproduce the problem. For help with this, read How to create a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example.

If it is possible to create a live example of the problem that you can link to (for example, on [sqlfiddle.com](http://sqlfiddle.com/), [jsbin.com](http://jsbin.com/) or [hasteb.in](https://hasteb.in/)) then do so - but also copy the code into the question itself. 

Not everyone can access external sites, and the links may break over time. Use Stack Snippets to make a live demo of inline JavaScript / HTML / CSS.

### **DO NOT post images of code, data, error messages, etc** 
Copy or type the text into the question. Please reserve the use of images for diagrams or demonstrating rendering bugs, things that are impossible to describe accurately via text. For more information please see the Meta FAQ entry Why not upload images of code/errors when asking a question?
- Include all relevant tags
- Try to include a tag for the language, library, and specific API your question relates to. If you start typing in the tags field, the system will suggest tags that match what you've typed - be sure and read the descriptions given for them to make sure they're relevant to the question you're asking! See also: What are tags, and how should I use them?

### Proof-read before posting
Now that you're ready to ask your question, take a deep breath and read through it from start to finish. Pretend you're seeing it for the first time: does it make sense? Try reproducing the problem yourself, in a fresh environment and make sure you can do so using only the information included in your question. Add any details you missed and read through it again. Now is a good time to make sure that your title still describes the problem!

Post the question and respond to feedback
After you post, leave the question open in your browser for a bit, and see if anyone comments. If you missed an obvious piece of information, be ready to respond by editing your question to include it. If someone posts an answer, be ready to try it out and provide feedback!

### Look for help asking for help
In spite of all your efforts, you may find your questions poorly-received. Don't despair! Learning to ask a good question is a worthy pursuit, and not one you'll master overnight. 

## [How to ask questions the smart way](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)

Before asking a technical question by e-mail, or in a newsgroup, or on a website chat board, do the following:

- Try to find an answer by searching the archives of the forum or mailing list you plan to post to.
- Try to find an answer by searching the Web.
- Try to find an answer by reading the manual.
- Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ.
- Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.
- Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend.

If you're a programmer, try to find an answer by reading the source code.

### Describe the problem's symptoms, not your guesses
It's not useful to tell hackers what you think is causing your problem. (If your diagnostic theories were such hot stuff, would you be consulting others for help?) So, make sure you're telling them the raw symptoms of what goes wrong, rather than your interpretations and theories. Let them do the interpretation and diagnosis. If you feel it's important to state your guess, clearly label it as such and describe why that answer isn't working for you.

**Not Helpful:**

> I'm getting back-to-back SIG11 errors on kernel compiles, and suspect a hairline crack on one of the motherboard traces. What's the best way to check for those?

**Helpful:**
> My home-built K6/233 on an FIC-PA2007 motherboard (VIA Apollo VP2 chipset) with 256MB Corsair PC133 SDRAM starts getting frequent SIG11 errors about 20 minutes after power-on during the course of kernel compiles, but never in the first 20 minutes. Rebooting doesn't restart the clock, but powering down overnight does. Swapping out all RAM didn't help. The relevant part of a typical compile session log follows.
